pg_rman
=======
pg_rman is an online backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL.

The goal of the pg_rman project is to provide a method for online backup
and PITR that is as easy as pg_dump. Also, it maintains a backup catalog
per database cluster. Users can maintain old backups including archive
logs with one command.

Branches
--------
There are several branches within pg_rman repository in order to work with
different PostgreSQL server versions without introducing server version
check code blocks.  Please choose a branch to match the PostgreSQL version
you will be building pg_rman against.

* master : branch for PostgreSQL 17 [![Test](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_rman/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_rman/actions/workflows/build.yml)

How to use
----------

To take an online backup, use the `backup` command:

````
$ pg_rman backup --backup-mode=full --with-serverlog
INFO: copying database files
INFO: copying archived WAL files
INFO: copying server log files
INFO: backup complete
INFO: Please execute 'pg_rman validate' to verify the files are correctly copied.
````

To list all the backups taken so far, use the `show` command:

````
$ pg_rman show

````

To restore from a backup, use the `restore` command.  Up to PostgreSQL11, note that pg_rman itself generates the `recovery.conf` file required to perform PostgreSQL PITR.

````
$ pg_ctl stop -m immediate
$ pg_rman restore
$ cat data/recovery.signal
# recovery.signal generated by pg_rman 1.3.16
$ cat data/pg_rman_recovery.conf
# added by pg_rman 1.3.16
restore_command = 'cp /home/postgres/arclog/%f %p'
recovery_target_timeline = '1'
````

After to PostgreSQL12, note that pg_rman itself added PostgreSQL PITR related options to `postgresql.conf` file and generates the `recovery.signal` file in $PGDATA.

To see more options to use with each command, run `pg_rman --help`.

Also, see the documentation for detailed usage:
