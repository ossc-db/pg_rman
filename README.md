pg_rman
=======
pg_rman is an online backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL.

The goal of the pg_rman project is providing a method for
online backup and PITR as easy as pg_dump. Also, it maintains
a backup catalog per database cluster. Users can maintain old
backups including archive logs with one command.

Branches
--------
There are several branches on pg_rman in order to work with
different PostgreSQL server versions without introducing
server version check code blocks.
Please choose branch with PostgreSQL version you use.

* master : branch for latest PostgreSQL develop version [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ossc-db/pg_rman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ossc-db/pg_rman)

How to use
----------
Pg_rman can take an online backup with one command.

````
$ pg_rman backup --backup-mode=full --with-serverlog
INFO: database backup start
NOTICE:  pg_stop_backup complete, all required WAL segments have been archived
````

The backup taken before are listed by show command:

````
$ pg_rman show

````

The restore from backup also can be done from pg_rman.
The recovery.conf is generated by pg_rman.

````
$ pg_ctl stop -m immediate
$ pg_rman restore
$ cat $PGDATA/recovery.conf
# recovery.conf generated by pg_rman 1.2.11
restore_command = 'cp /home/postgres/arclog/%f %p'
recovery_target_timeline = '1'
$ pg_ctl start
````
